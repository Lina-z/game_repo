# Welcome young padawan

The force is definitely strong with you... but you must train a lot before claiming the rank of master.
Let's try something..

You should use : 
**KeyUp arrow** and **keyDown arrow** to lift an object. 

That's it, you are good to go.

Let's try heavy lifting that rock and avoid any obstacle or you will have to try again.

**May the force be with you**
